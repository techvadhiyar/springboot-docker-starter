Case for Docker Containers
===========================

Installing  Docker on Windows 10
=================================

Running a Spring Boot Application from a DOCKER container
=========================================================
https://stackabuse.com/dockerizing-a-spring-boot-application/ (fantastic article !!!!)


NOTE: the root directory of the application is where the “Dockerfile” resides. 
Also run everything from a WINDOWS POWERSHELL tool.
When manually doing the docker build run the following commands: 
(ALWAYS USE THE WINDOWS POWERSHELL WHEN RUNNING THESE COMMANDS)
(prerequisite: make sure that you've run a maven install and have the latest jar file in the "target" folder)
1. docker build -t springboot-docker-starter . (the dot in the end is very important - it means all)
2. docker images  (just to check that the image has been created)
3. docker run -d -p 8090:8080 <docker image-name> (to run the docker container on a different port - the -d is to run it as a background process)
4. docker container ls  (this will tell you the pid of the docker container)

Make sure you can run your service individually from spring.
Make sure you can run your service individually on docker locally.

The best way is to run it from your maven build - the stackhouse article explains how to do it.

Pushing docker image to docker hub
==================================
Nice video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdQ7MmQNTa0
Nice video (more basic) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SYJQ-z4LBw  --- this one really helped me !!!!

docker commit <local container pid> <docker hub login>/<image name>  --- this will create the new docker hub repo for this image for different tags.
docker images --- confirm that the new docker hub repo image is created
docker login --- login to the docker hub repo
docker push <docker hub login/<image name> 

In the case of this project:
docker commit a8c604236ff4 pointinsights/springboot-docker-starter
docker images
docker login
docker push  pointinsights/springboot-docker-starter <:tag name>  -- the tag name is optional - useful only when there are multiple versions of this image.

This is how you tag a local image - https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/
